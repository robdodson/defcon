# Defcon!!!

Defcon is a stopwatch running on Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io.
It is intended to be a good starting point if you're just learning to use
web sockets. It currently uses xhr-polling so it is compatible with Heroku.

# Who's it for?

I originally wrote Defcon over four blog posts introducing Socket.io and
deploying to Heroku. Please checkout the posts on my site, [robdodson.me](http://robdodson.me)
